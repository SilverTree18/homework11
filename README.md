<b>Bamazon</b>

I created a mini-shopping experience using mySQL and Node.  When you run “node bamazonCustomer.js”, you will see a list of 11 items’:
- Unique ID for each product
- Name of Product
- Department of Product
- Price
- Quantity Available

After reviewing the choices, you can select the ID number of the item you would like to purchase.  You will then be asked a quantity.  The program will fulfill your order and give you a total amount due including 7.75% tax.  If you ask for more items than are available, you will be notified and asked to make a new selection.
